Advanced Topics: Tools
    Export External
        Explain how exporting works
    Relax To Selection
        Delta Mush between objects
    Tweak Mix
        Should this be the default?

Advanced Topics: Menu options
    Show the FULL tree with hide redundant off

Advanced Topics: Splitting
    Split Naming Convention
    Requires Numpy
    Works externally
    Falloffs
        Edit Falloffs
        Active Development
        Map falloffs planned for the future
        Sorry, no live splitting yet
            Maya doesn't allow for weightmaps plugged into shapes on their blendshape
            Maybe a new blendshape plugin
    Split Exporting

Advanced Topics: Shape Inversion
    Some thoughts on the algorithm
        Build a matrix per point
        Nothing else needs the DCC afterwards
        Works well with basic skinning, maybe less so with more advanced deformations
    This topic requires knowledge of the rigging system
        That's why this doesn't have a UI
        Currently automated in our pipeline

Advanced Topic: Playing with Points
    Unsubdivision
        Part of our automated face update script
        Un-subdivides externally without any user intervention
        Only for meshes with the proper topology
        Not a *TRUE* unsubdivision (working on it)
    Reordering
        MeshCrawler reordering
        No UI yet, but very useful

Advanced Topic: Toolbars and Right Clicks
    This one is going to be a lot of code
    Show the simple plugin system
        registerTool and registerContext

Super Advanced: Writing your own Interface
    A quick tour and history
        Basic layer structure: Dialog, Items, Interface, DCC
        Blur uses whatever's good for the job, so we have to support it
    A look through the Maya interface
        Best way is to just look at the code and re-implement
    Showing a more complex example in XSI
        The "thing" is actually a list
